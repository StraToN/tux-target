THE GAME
--------

The goal is to jump and to land on the best target to score points.

You start on the top of a ramp, you must increase your speed to
fly away. 

Keyboard Commands:

Up Arrow	: Accelerate
Down Arrow	: Deccelerate
Right Arrow	: Move Right
Left Arrow	: Move Left
Right CRTL	: Open / Close the ball

When you are in the sky, you must open the ball pressing RIGHT CONTROL.
Now you are in flying mode. Left and Right keys always control the direction.
The Up key increase your speed but you will fall faster. When you use the Down key,
your speed decrease but you will fall slower.

You must now manage to go to the best target you think you can reach.

When you are near the target, you must again press the RIGHT CTRL Key to go back
in rolling mode and fall nearly vertically, bounce and stop on the target.

If you fall in the water, you'll win 0 point even if you previously touched a target.

!Warning!, other players can kick you out the target, even if you are stopped on it.

You can only open and close your ball once during the session.
